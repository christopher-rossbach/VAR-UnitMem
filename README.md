# Searching for Memorization in Visual Auto Regressive models using UnitMem

In this repository I search for memorization in [VAR-models](https://github.com/FoundationVision/VAR), to study where memorization in visual generative models happens.
Specifically, I implement the **UnitMem** (slightly adjusted) for searching and quantifying memorization at the unit (neuron/channel) level in large-scale autoregressive models.

I added a [Notebook](UnitMem.ipynb) and a small report to the original VAR repro, from which this is forked.
